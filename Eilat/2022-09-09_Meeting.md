Dylan Titmuss  

#### Attendees
Eyal, Boaz, Dylan, Aleck, Jim

#### Selected notes (Dylan was working with CHANOS during meeting)
* Autosampler will be a backup in case CHANOS isn't functional
* Eyal would like us to start from slightly elevated Omega (~5.2-5.3) and watch it descend along with precipitation. -- a big step toward modeling what a sinking particle does in the Gulf

#### Next week's meeting
*
