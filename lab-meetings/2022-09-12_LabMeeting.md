## CHANOS updates

# Current CHANOS
* Would like temperature probe, but things aren't working. Currently has internal probe. Found a spare probe, need to test with new board. 
* Troubleshooting: Steve asked questions, needs to hear back from Dylan. Is there high load? Rebooted? Uptime was still high. 
* What was system load when running slowly? Need to check it next time. If it goes up, change monitoring to exclude full DIC status. 
* After Ethernet went down and came back, the system did go down and reboot itself. 
* Tprobe definitely doesn't work. Does Tprobe have to be the internal temperature? Turn on Tprobe and turn on dataloggers in order to operate external probe. Previously * Tprobe was inside the pressure housing. What's plugged where now? 
* Need to distinguish ambient electronic temperature vs environmental temperature. 
* How accurate is the probe? Jonathan will check the Sparkfun data sheet. Can we use as proxy for Z-cell temperature? We can move it next to Z-cell. 
* Simpler solution: put another one next to Z-cell? 
* Aim to ship next Friday the 23rd. 
* Avoid FedEx, use DHL. 
* Need working CTD and CHANOS. O2 also good, and Anderra seems to be working. 
* Steve needs remote time on CHANOS. 
* Fritz will put a chip for temperature and will drop it off for Aleck. 
* Does Dylan need help packing & preparing shipment? Jonathan will get spare pumps, connectors, etc. Dylan will get fittings etc. When returning, plan to return to same box. 
* Customs forms. Ins vs duties. Need to talk with Israel collaborators. 

# New CHANOS
* Let's all think about the software. How can we improve user friendliness? 
    *  New processor. Steve will use a new 7600 to work on development. Jonathan will get ready what Steve needs. 
    *  Could we use model viewer without user interface? The user interface is the ethernet. It *can* run autonomously when running a sequence w/o interface. 

## OCIA

* Jonathan made a block model diagram. Did Fritz see it? 
* Fritz sharing a diagram. 

## Kate

* Andrea coming soon to learn DIC. Need to take care of subcontract. 
* Mississippi GO data processing is happening. 
* Shipping needs to happen soon, too, and we will replace chiller. 
* Will start SAMI calibrations at AVAST soon.
