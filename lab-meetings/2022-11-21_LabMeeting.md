## Lab Meeting 21 Nov 2022 
First one after Israel trip

# Updates from Israel/precipitation 

CHANOS got stuck in customs. Ran a number of experiments, mainly with 700 m bottom sediments. 
Most exciting piece was a correlation btw magnitude of sediment used and decline in alkalinity. 
Also an interesting DIC signal in pretty much every experiment consistent with air-sea exchange. 
Flood sediment had as expected larger magnitude of signal. 
Spontaneous experiments with sodium hydroxide. Saw whitening in one!
Will share data soon. 
-> Plan for meetings every two weeks. DT will email to set up. 
-> Set objectives. What are the final products from each data set? Who will make them? At least one paper. Linked to Gilli's thesis. 
-> Report needs to get in now. 

# RSA

Need to get regular meetings back on calendar. 
DT has been working with DO data. 

# KM updates

Running OOI samples. Trouble with TA
-> Need to get NCA titrator running. 
Could run OOI on that. 

# AGU fall meeting week of Dec 12

ZAW attending and giving
OOI lightning talk
-> Need one slide to show OOI data DIC-TA-PH
  identify by water masses? Gulf Stream, jet, shore
  
 # NOAA CHANOS
 
 JP sharing timeline with goal of delivery March 1. 
 A lot hinges on PCB design and pressure chamber fabrication. 
 Gas exchange cell needs to be fabricated. 
 Cruise is planned for May, with JP going. There are two legs. Should he go on both?
 Will they keep CHANOS after this? 
 Should we get another laptop to go with it? 
 Who is doing the software on their side?
 They need to buy cables.
 They have a supply budget. 
 
 # Plan to use CHANOS for a new project starting next year
 Need number of pins and connector types for power and communication. 
 Want to put it on a float. 
 Need a cable ~10 m. 
 Need a redesign for CHANOS to enable easier communication integration?
 Discussion of possibly changing pin configuration. We can switch from 13- pin to 2 and 8 if we want to later. 
 A 2-pin would be helpful for a CTD (on battery power and without communications). 
 Would need to engineer protection against someone plugging in two power supplies. 
 => Want everyone trained on using CHANOS. Including ZAW!
 What is plan for updating pumps, etc? Depends on funding. 
 SL considering cleaning up code to eliminate old pumps. So software would not be backwards compatible. 
 Could swap 7800s into old CHANOS. Could swap in new pumps depending on funding. Have enough boards. 
 The new pumps for the new CHANOS are made by Jason-- the Kapit pump and the Panda driver. 
 The drivers are soldered onto the boards, not plugin like last version. So if they fail, replace the whole board. (Actually more cost-effective this way.)
 Takosago/piezo pumps still in consideration for pH sensors. Those would take completely different motor drivers.
