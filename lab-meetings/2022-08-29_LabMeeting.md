#### CPO updates
- Jennie submitted CPO paper last week! Woohoo!
- Now have a massive & really cool set of daily open ocean data to dig into (thanks, Ivan)

#### OCB update
- Planning to collaborate with Rachel Eveleth on OOI analysis b/c she's working on something very similar. Will discuss with Aleck separately (also OOI pCO2).

#### OCIA updates
- Jennie's mixer tests with Ocean Optics spec are going very slowly (10 mins of high-freq optical data is *a lot*), but otherwise look good – 2D a little faster than 3D right now
- Jonathan has no OCIA updates – focusing on CHANOS right now
- Need to discuss how to reach a meaningful end result in the time available. Can discuss bigger picture & more specifics during tomorrow's OCIA/CHANOS meeting.
- Fritz is looking to Jennie/Jonathan/Aleck on where to go next.

#### CHANOS updates
- Aleck talked to WHOI shipping folks: sounds like we can ship 3-4 weeks ahead of time (late Sept) for things to reach Eilat in time. Still, would be good to pack sooner if possible.
- For new unit: meeting with NOAA folks (HabCam & EcoMon) this Friday. (Google Meet link was sent by Chris Melrose. Aleck will forward to Fritz.)
- Will discuss boards for new unit in-depth during tomorrow's OCIA/CHANOS meeting.
- Jonathan now has all replacement circuit boards for current CHANOS; currently working on assembling them. Hopefully will have power to boards tomorrow; hopefully will have working unit by the end of the week. Fingers crossed!
- Is the env board actively being used in current CHANOS? Only for humidity/leak detect. Can potentially forego it for now, since the leak box doesn't collect standing water, thereby rendering the leak detector ineffective.
- Leak box is, quite simply, useless for preventing leaks.
- "I think we should try to avoid leaking into the electronics." – Steve ;)
- Despite dysfunction, leak box is still a good way to secure the z-cell to prevent motion. If z-cell is well-sealed, leak box is redundant – Dylan would be comfortable testing & then trusting the z-cell itself. Or can add a plastic bag around it!
- W/r/t filtration experiments – Dylan has established an effective filtration method, where a single 0.45um filter lasts for 3-4 hours. Will test additional nylon layer(s) around pump intake + second syringe filter to see if that extends the duration.
- Dylan measured DIC change over time using this set-up – replicates look good + data shows a decrease in DIC over time (esp. in 0-30 min time frame). Will send data + visualization out to Aleck & Israeli collaborators.
- Will use this Friday's Eilat meeting to plan specifics of our experiments in Israel – duration (last time ~3 hrs; Eyal suggested 8 hrs for this time based on Gilli's work), frequency of bottle sampling, concentration(s), etc.

#### DIC optode updates
- Funded! Woohoo!
- Jonathan shifting course for his GRFP proposal – focusing on furthering the OCIA project instead (full version &/or handheld version)

#### General points
- Aleck will add missing proposals for already-funded projects to the relevant Drive folder.
- We should discuss plans for lab management + addition of more personnel in the near future.
